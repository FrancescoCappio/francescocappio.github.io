# Bio 

I'm a Research Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/author/francesco-cappio-borlino),
working on Anomaly Detection for Computer Vision applications. I have a PhD in Computer Vision from
[Politecnico di
Torino](https://www.polito.it/didattica/dottorato-di-ricerca-e-scuola-di-specializzazione/alumni?p=052409)
where I have been part of the [Vandal lab](http://vandal.polito.it/). I'm passionate about new
technologies as I'm convinced they can improve our life. Still, I firmly believe these improvements
should benefit all: **knowledge should be open, personal data should stay private**.

## Skills 

I speak **Italian**, **English** and a bit of **French**.

I am a *skilled developer* and a *fast learner*. I have used **Linux** for my whole life and thus have
some sysadmin experience. 

I've also got some experience in many of the most common programming languages as **C, C++, Python, Java,
and Bash**, but I have also used SQL, Javascript, and  PHP. 

I have developed native applications for Linux with C/C++, GUIs with Qt, and mobile applications
with Android Studio. I used scikit-learn for traditional Machine Learning problems and Hadoop and
Spark for Big Data analysis. I have gained experience about many AWS services, from Lambdas, to
Dynamo, and most importantly many tools of the SageMaker family.

I develop **Deep Learning** projects with **PyTorch, Jax+Flax** and any other tool that can come in handy. 

I use Arch Linux and vim, because **I love simplicity**. 

## Research interests 

It is well known that **Deep Learning** solutions have enabled to obtain **excellent performance** in many
**Computer Vision tasks** in the last years. Still, the **transition from lab settings to real world
applications** is not trivial and can, in some cases, **determine a drastic reduction in the
effectiveness of some innovations**. 
My research goal in the long term is to alleviate some of the causes of this performance drop, 
in particular I focus on semantic and visual domain shifts.
With this objective in mind, I work on the design of models which prove a great **robustness to test
scenarios that differ from the training ones**. This result can be even more interesting if it is
reached in **label-scarce settings**, i.e. without requiring human intervention to guide models learning. 
The desired result is to build models that can be applied in visual domains for which no data or no labels are available
at training time, without recording a significant performance drop, and at the same time that are
able to correctly discern between objects they know and objects not seen before. 

I generally focus on the tasks of visual object detection and object recognition.

## Personal interests 

I come from a [small town in the mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aosta) and I really **love
hiking**!

I also like **cooking** and **reading**, I used to think that one day I would become a writer!

I believe that **Climate Change** is the most important battle of our time.
