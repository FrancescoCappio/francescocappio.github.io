# Bio 

I'm a Research Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/author/francesco-cappio-borlino),
working on Anomaly Detection for Computer Vision applications. I have a PhD in Computer Vision from
[Politecnico di
Torino](https://www.polito.it/didattica/dottorato-di-ricerca-e-scuola-di-specializzazione/alumni?p=052409)
where I have been part of the [Vandal lab](http://vandal.polito.it/). I'm passionate about new
technologies as I'm convinced they can improve our life. Still, I firmly believe these improvements
should benefit all: **knowledge should be open, personal data should stay private**.
