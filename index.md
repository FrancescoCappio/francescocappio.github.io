# Bio 

I'm a PhD Student researching **Deep Learning** at [Politecnico di Torino](www.polito.it) in the
[Vandal lab](http://vandal.polito.it/). I'm passionate about new
technologies as I'm convinced they can improve our life. Still, I firmly believe these improvements
should benefit all: **knowledge should be open, personal data should stay private**.
